Homework

In this homework, you are expected to implement the following (in any programming language):
1) Generate an RSA public-private key pair. KA+ and KA-.
2) Generate a 128 bit symmetric key KS. Encypt it with KA+, print the result, and then decrypt it with KA-. Again print the result.
3) Consider a long text m. Apply SHA2 Hash algorithm (Obtain the message digest, H(m)). Then encrypt it with KA-. 
(Thus generate a digital signature.) Then verify the digital signature. (Decrypt it with KA+, apply Hash algorithm to the message,compare).
4) Consider a text m. Apply HMAC using KS and SHA2 algorithms.
5) Encypt a long text using AES algorithm in CBC mode. Print the result. (IV should be randomly generated, Key = KS) Then decrypt it. 
Again print the result.
